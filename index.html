        <h2>Go Into a Calorie Deficit</h2>
        <p>
A calorie deficit is when you consume fewer calories than your body expends in a day.  It is a crucial component to weight loss. It's important to know that  everything you eat and drink provides calories to your body except water. These calories are used to maintain your organs, healthy tissue, breathing, heartbeat, and every movement you make. If you consume more calories than needed, your body stores the extra energy for later use. However, if you consistently eat more calories than necessary, your body continues to store energy without using much of it. Over time, this can lead to weight gain.  </p>
        <p>Creating a calorie deficit involves a dual approach: reducing calories(eating less) and increasing physical activities (burning more). By combining these, you can lose weight, gain strength and muscle. Jumping rope, running, walking, strength training are exercises recommended by experts to support your weight loss goals
</p>
    <p>On average, adult women need about 1,600 to 2,400 calories per day to maintain their weight, depending on their activity level and individual needs. For adult men, the typical range is 2,000 to 3,000 calories per day, considering factors like age and activity level. Use a  Calorie Calculator to figure out exactly how many calories you need a day. A general guideline is to create a 500-calorie deficit per day. Since 3,500 calories make up a pound of fat, this theoretically leads to a 1-pound weight loss per week. Doctors recommend you lose 1 pound a week, more will result in exhaustion, muscle loss and weaker immune system</p>

        <h2>Balance a good and healthy nutrition</h2>
       <p>To build muscle and lose fat, a healthy nutrition needs to be implemented. Fast foods, meals with excessive added sugars, Processed Foods and any food with an excessive amount of Sodium need to be avoided. These bad meals could lead to having an unhealthy body and a weak immune system.  Protein should be prioritized for muscle repair and growth. Aim to consume lean sources of protein such as chicken breast, fish, tofu, beans, and Greek yogourt. A general recommendation is to consume about 0.8-1 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day for muscle building.
</p>
	    <p> A crucial thing to for weight loss are Healthy fats. They are important for hormone production and overall health. Incorporate sources like avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish (such as salmon) into your diet. These fats also help with satiety and can aid in fat loss, however we must not forget that even healthy foods can contribute to weight gain if consumed in excess. Use portion control techniques such as measuring servings, using smaller plates, and paying attention to hunger cues to avoid overeating.
