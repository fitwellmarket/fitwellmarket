        <h2>Go Into a Calorie Deficit</h2>
        <p>
A calorie deficit is when you consume fewer calories than your body expends in a day.  It is a crucial component to weight loss. It's important to know that  everything you eat and drink provides calories to your body except water. These calories are used to maintain your organs, healthy tissue, breathing, heartbeat, and every movement you make. If you consume more calories than needed, your body stores the extra energy for later use. However, if you consistently eat more calories than necessary, your body continues to store energy without using much of it. Over time, this can lead to weight gain.  </p>
        <p>Creating a calorie deficit involves a dual approach: reducing calories(eating less) and increasing physical activities (burning more). By combining these, you can lose weight, gain strength and muscle. Jumping rope, running, walking, strength training are exercises recommended by experts to support your weight loss goals
</p>
    <p>On average, adult women need about 1,600 to 2,400 calories per day to maintain their weight, depending on their activity level and individual needs. For adult men, the typical range is 2,000 to 3,000 calories per day, considering factors like age and activity level. Use a  Calorie Calculator to figure out exactly how many calories you need a day. A general guideline is to create a 500-calorie deficit per day. Since 3,500 calories make up a pound of fat, this theoretically leads to a 1-pound weight loss per week. Doctors recommend you lose 1 pound a week, more will result in exhaustion, muscle loss and weaker immune system</p>
